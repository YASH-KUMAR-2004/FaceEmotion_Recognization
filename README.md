# Facial Attribute Analysis with DeepFace

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform facial attribute analysis on an image using the DeepFace library in Python. It uses OpenCV for image handling and DeepFace for detecting age, gender, emotion, and other facial features.

## Features
- Load and display images using OpenCV and Matplotlib.
- Use DeepFace to analyze:
  - Emotion
  - Age
  - Gender
  - Race
- Flatten and display DeepFace output for easier access.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  - opencv-python
  - matplotlib
  - deepface
  - tensorflow

### Installation

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python matplotlib deepface tensorflow
